    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum algorithms based on the idea of **variational quantum circuits** can be executed on near-term quantum devices to tackle some optimization problems$^1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is variational quantum circuit? After reading this post, you will get an answer to the question thanks to intuitive explanation and a simple example in Python [PennyLane](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library from Xanadu.\n",

    "- **Learning algorithm** and objective function with respect to which, the parameterized unitary is trained.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will go through each of these elements separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterized quantum circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameterized quantum circuit $U(x,\\theta)$ is a unitary transformation that is $\\theta$-parameterized ($\\theta$ is a vector) and $x$-parameterized ($x$ is an input vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Yz4CrOg.png\" title=\"Variational quantum circuit is parameterized by input x and free parameters theta.\" style=\"width: 250px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can decompose the unitary $U(x,\\theta)$ into a set of smaller unitaries. An **example** of such variational quantum circuit with $\\theta=[\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3]^T$ is presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wviLmen.png\" title=\"An example of variational quantum circuit. Note that there are many ways of how you construct variational circuit architecture.\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_0(x)$ encodes an input data $x$ into a quantum state. Unitaries such as $U_2(\\theta_2)$ are parameterized quantum gates, for instance $U_2(\\theta_2)=R_X(\\theta_2)$, which is a single-qubit rotation through angle $\\theta_2$ around the x-axis (on Bloch sphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0qzyniG.gif\" title=\"Rotation around x axis for theta ∈ [0,2π].\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Take note that variational circuits can also contain gates which are not parameterized (like $H$, $\\textit{CNOT}$, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we extract information from $U(x,\\theta)$, i.e. how quantum information is converted into classical one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we measure an observable $\\hat{B}$ at the output. However, a single measurement would not give much information in this case. Therefore, we repeat the measurement many times (each time we prepare the quantum circuit from scratch) to get an **estimate of expectation value**, which is a function of $x$ and $\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f(x,\\theta) &= \\langle 0 | U^{\\dagger}(x,\\theta)\\hat{B}U(x,\\theta)) |0 \\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gbSxUXY.png\" title=\"Repetitive measurements constitute for an estimate of expectation value of some chosen observable.\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As an observable we can use a subset of [Pauli operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) $\\{\\hat{B}\\} \\subset \\{I,\\sigma_x,\\sigma_y,\\sigma_z\\}^{\\otimes N}$ (for example $\\sigma_z$ measured on each qubit).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key insight** is that $\\theta$ parameters can be adjusted so that an objective function is minimized and variational circuit produces the desired output. This sound like a supervised machine learning algorithm, and in fact variational quantum circuits can be used for that kind of purposes (see this blog post about [Quantum Circuit Learning](http://dkopczyk.quantee.co.uk/qcl/) algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, variational circuits are trained using classical optimization algorithm such as [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) - this is why variational circuits belong to the hybrid quantum-classical family. The objective function is $f(x,\\theta)$ usually subject to some classical post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vOdTw3M.png\" title=\"Learning of variational quantum circuit involves iterative execution of quantum and classical parts of the algorithm.\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, if it is still not clear what variational circuit does from theory, let's analyze a very simple example of a single-qubit variational circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We would take $U(x,\\theta)$ to be just single gate circuit and single parameterized - for example qubit rotation around y-axis i.e. $R_Y(\\theta)$ gate. Here, $\\theta$ is just a number. Moreover, we quietly assumed that our input $x$ is directly encoded as the state $\\rangle 0 |$, so that the term $x$ will disappear from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EFrhTAw.png\" title=\"Single parameterized gate circuit.\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit after $R_Y(\\theta)$ application is in the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "| \\psi(\\theta)\\rangle&=R_Y(\\theta)  |0\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} & -\\sin{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} \\\\ \\sin{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} & \\cos{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\ &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} \\\\ \\sin{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}\\end{bmatrix}  \\,.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "As an output we measure the expectation value of Pauli-Z operator $\\sigma_z$. If we would like to calculate the expectation value $f(\\theta)$ on a piece of paper it would follows as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f(\\theta) &= \\langle 0 | R_Y^{\\dagger}(\\theta)\\sigma_z R_Y(\\theta) |0\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ &= \\langle \\psi(\\theta) |\\sigma_z |\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} & \\sin{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} \\\\ \\sin{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}\\end{bmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\ &= \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) - \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the parameterized circuit on the classical simulator and check whether the results match theory. We will use [PennyLane](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) from Xanadu, as a Python library for the simulation of hybrid quantum-classical computations. As the first step, use ```$ pip install pennylane```  or follow the instructions on how to install PennyLane library [here](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the simulator of a quantum device with ```qml.device``` statement and define the circuit as a function that accepts params  argument and return an expectation value of observable $\\sigma_z$. Take note that the function decorator ``` @qml.qnode(dev)``` is used to connect circuit definition with the device."

    "To sum up, variational quantum circuit uses both classical machine and quantum device (actually quantum device simulation on classical machine, but we apply the same logic on real quantum device).

These parameters were suggested by optimization algorithm executed on the classical machine.\n",
